Data is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes

Author: Aditya, retrieved 19 Feb 2025.

On the Kaggle page, multiple .csv files are provided by the author. The data has been aggregated into the file **all_cars.csv** with the code provided in the **data_aggregating.py** file. The Hyundai file originally contains a faulty feature name which has been manually corrected beforehand. Only some of the provided .csv files have been used.

Subsequently, the data has been preprocessed via the **data_preprocessing.ipynb** file. The resulting data frame has been stored in **all_cars_transformed.csv**.
