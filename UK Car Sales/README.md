## Second-Hand Car Sales

#### A project in which I visualized data from a second-hand car sales platform.

<br> </br>
**Goals:**
* Showcasing hands-on experience with Python and **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* Creating valuable graphs for my GitHub portfolio
* Creating insights from publicly available data

<br></br>
**Tools and Data:**
* Python, Matplotlib
* [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes)

<br></br>
**Provided Files:**
* On the Kaggle page, multiple .csv files are provided by the author. The data has been aggregated into the file **all_cars.csv** with the code provided in the **data_aggregating.py** file. The Hyundai file originally contains a faulty feature name which has been manually corrected beforehand. Only some of the provided .csv files have been used.
* Subsequently, the data has been preprocessed via the **data_preprocessing.ipynb** file. The resulting data frame has been stored in **all_cars_transformed.csv**.
* All graphs and data can be found in the **Resources** repository.
